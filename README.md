# Hue color changes on Spotify genre

Do you always have problems with mood swings? Than you're at the right place!

This repository will show you how to make your Philips Hue lights change color with the genre of your Spotify song! Because not everyone is into Python, here an explanation of our script:

# Get started

First we have to install the required depencies, to do so you can run the following command:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

or

```pip install phue```,
```pip install spotipy```,
```pip install SwSpotify```

Over the time these depencies need to be updated, to do so run the same command but add ```-- upgrade``` at the end!

# Extra information

Note: this program is not finished yet, so the Python code will change over time!
